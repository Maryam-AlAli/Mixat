# Mixat: A Data Set of Bilingual Emirati-English Speech

## Introduction
Mixat is a dataset of Emirati speech code-mixed with English. It was developed to address the shortcomings of current speech recognition resources when applied to Emirati speech, especially in bilingual contexts where speakers frequently mix and switch between their local dialect and English. The dataset consists of 15 hours of speech derived from two public podcasts featuring native Emirati speakers. The data collection process, annotation, and dataset statistics are described in detail in the accompanying paper.

## Data Set Construction
The audio content for Mixat was sourced from two podcasts produced by native Emirati speakers: "The Direction" and "Think With Hessa." These podcasts cover a diverse range of topics and provide examples of Emirati-English code-switching in conversational and monologue formats. The data collection involved extracting audio from 28 podcast episodes and annotating the content to identify code-switching points.

## Data Set Statistics
